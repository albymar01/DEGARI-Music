    "lyrics": "\"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\" \"But I'm only going to get this one chance\" ( Six minutes--, six minutes-- ) \"Something's wrong, I can feel it\" ( Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on! ) \"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\" \"You are just what the doc ordered\" I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic ( Kill 'em all with ) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!) MCs get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position To meet Run-D.M.C., and induct them Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-lookin' boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!) You're witnessin' a mass-occur Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy \"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"--that's all they say, lookin' boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy? I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face, lookin' boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-- I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton--no, Asgard, Asgard So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin You rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off, then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep-throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin' in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed ( J.J. Fad ) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music \"Oh, he's too mainstream.\" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it \"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"--'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it \"I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use.\" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard--be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?",

Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking, make me king As we move toward a new world order A normal life is boring, but superstardom's Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better No more games, I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to- Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me To the point I'm like a snail, I've got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better You can do anything you set your mind to, man",

Straighten up, little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you cryin' about? You got me Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you wanna cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein' Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright Heh, it's funny I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying 'Cause Daddy felt like a bum--see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot So Mama moved back onto Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV And Mama didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin' Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise Mama's gon' be alright And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)",

Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face? Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case? Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns Then hop online like \"Pray for my city,\" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky I'll park his son The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted What is it? The braids? I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh You know I got language barriers, huh It's no accent you can sell me, huh Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women And notice, I said \"we,\" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin' How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough? How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough? I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin' Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk Remember?

I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray? I pray all ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane, and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast) Don't go chasing waterfalls ( Don't go, don't go ) Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all ( I know, I know, your way, hey ) But I think you're moving too fast",

    "lyrics": "Back through the years I go wandering once again Back to the seasons of my youth I recall a box of rags that someone gave us And how my mama put the rags to use There were rags of many colors, every piece was small And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my mama made for me Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my mama made for me So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me In my coat of many colors my mama made for me But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see That one is only poor only if they choose to be Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my mama made for me Made just for me",
